# rn-motion-ui

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 17c2ce8: Remove `PredictionMarket` component

  The `PredictionMarket` component and its `./prediction-market` subpath export have been removed from the package. Consumers importing from `rn-motion-ui/prediction-market` must remove those imports.

### Patch Changes

- 17c2ce8: Fix animation correctness and loading indicators

  - **AnimatePresence**: exiting items now stay at their original list position instead of being appended at the end (insertion-order tracking via `keyOrderRef`).
  - **AnimatedList**: exit animation gains a downward `translateY: 8` drop alongside the existing fade+scale.
  - **Loader**: dots bounce now uses `EASE_IN_OUT` easing for a smoother feel.
  - **Button**: `buttonContent` rendered before ripples so it sits above them in z-order; `pointerEvents="none"` moved from `style` to a MotiView prop on each ripple.
  - **StatefulButton**: replaces the SVG spinning ring with a three-dot `DotsLoader`; button width is held stable during loading by keeping the idle text as a hidden sizer.
  - **ActionFeedbackModal**: loading state now uses `<Loader variant="dots">`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e9215d: Add five new components — `AdaptiveModal`, `AnimatedList`, `Card`, `CardChoice`, and `Skeleton` (each with stories and package exports) — and refine existing ones:

  - `ActionFeedbackModal`: rewrite the status icon as a single morphing vessel that animates size + fill colour across loading/success/error states while the glyph cross-fades, replacing the three static icon variants.
  - `CommandPalette`: rework layout and interaction handling.
  - `MultiStepMenu`: refine component and stories.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release of `rn-motion-ui` as a single package. Consolidates the former `@rn-motion-ui/{rn,moti,hooks,utils}` packages into one unscoped package with subpath exports (no barrel files): 40+ animated React Native / React Native Web UI components, the Moti/Reanimated 4 primitives, shared React hooks, and shared TypeScript utilities.
